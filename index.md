## Data and User Data

CalminityCircle is a static application that does not collect or store any personal data from its users. We do not use cookies, nor do we have any form of account creation or login functionality. The app does not require internet access for its functionality and, as such, does not transmit any data.

## Use of the Application

The CalminityCircle app is designed to be used as is. Since the app does not collect any personal information, there is no use of personal data.

## Children's Information

Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. CalminityCircle does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that your child provided this kind of information on our app, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately, and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.
